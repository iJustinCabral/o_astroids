## Astroids!

Another day, another remake of a classic game to help build up my understanding of game development with raylib. This time I chose Astroids! There are some concepts here that I've yet to work onwith any other of my games projects such as objects wrapping around from one side of the screen to the other. I also plan on not using sprites and drawing all the lines manually for each asset. 

Everyday of 2025 I continue to stay consistent and my convinction for why I learned to program 10 years ago becomes more and more solidifed. Although I sometimes feel like I wasted some years not stretching the bounds of my ability, its never to late to walk the path you want. Stay hungry, stay foolish.
